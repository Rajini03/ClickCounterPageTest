Automated the testing process for a Click Counter Application

  ●	Developed a Selenium script in Java to automate the user interaction with the "Click Me!" button on the application's interface.

  ●	Implemented a loop to simulate 100 clicks on the button and simultaneously fetched the updated count from a specific `<span>` element on the page.

  ●	Incorporated a verification step to ensure the count displayed on the page matched the iteration coun- If a mismatch was detected, the loop was broken, and a "Mismatch in count" message was printed.

  ●	Upon successfully executing all 100 iterations, the script printed "Click Counter App: Working as expected", confirming the application's functionality. 

Technologies used: Java, Selenium WebDriver
